# Community Maintainer Simulation

The goal of the Community Maintainer is to maintain the sense of community in a load-balanced environment. To do so, the system uses analytics of the users to figure out which players interacted with each other to calculate a proximity score and an overall server/channel community score.

## Getting Started

This project uses `Node.js`, `Socket.io` and `Three.js` for visuals.

## Deployment

No plan on deploying this to live servers for now.
