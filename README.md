# Community Maintainer Simulation

The goal of the Community Maintainer is to maintain the sense of community in a load-balanced environment. To do so, the system uses analytics of the users to figure out which players interacted with each other to calculate a proximity score and an overall server/channel community score.

## Getting Started

This project uses `Node.js`, `Socket.io` and `Three.js` for visuals.

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:DominicF96/community_maintainer_sim.git`;
2. Navigate to the project's root `cd community_maintainer_sim`;
3. Install dependencies `npm i`;
4. Start the project `npm start`.

## Deployment

No plan on deploying this to live servers for now.

## Where the Idea Came From

I was talking to some people about their childhood. They didn't really have a sense of community as a child, they were not encouraged to pursue any of their interest by their parents, making them incredibly isolated. This also caused that person to feel like they never truly belonged. Socializing became difficult as others didn't have the same interests which in turn caused their relation to be weaker.

I believe that this sense of community is crucial as it allows people to evolve into their best self while meeting people with similar interests. In case that child is in a toxic environment, being able to escape in a fun, positive and familiar environment has tremendous value.
